**RLN** is a privacy-first, zero-trust network orchestrator designed for the modern LAN. It provides instant visibility, cryptographic identity, and secure data movement without ever leaving your local subnet. No cloud, no telemetry, just pure local control.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔍 Hybrid Discovery**: Simultaneous Layer 2 (ARP/NDP) and Layer 3 (mDNS) scanning for full IPv4 and IPv6 coverage.
- **🏷️ Device Naming**: Resolves custom DHCP hostnames via Reverse DNS, with an automatic fallback to device vendor lookup via the bundled OUI database.
- **🕸️ Switch Topology**: Live LLDP frame capture to intelligently map out managed network switches and port connections.
- **📈 Stateful Monitoring**: Track network "drift" by comparing current scans against historical SQLite snapshots.
- **🛡️ Zero-Trust Identity**: Permanent, cryptographic Peer IDs (Ed25519) powered by `iroh`'s built-in key primitives.
- **🧠 Intelligent Fingerprinting**: Local ML models (via `tract`) identify device types based on network behavior.
- **🚀 High-Speed Streaming**: Encrypted, resilient file movement using QUIC-based P2P streaming (via `iroh` v0.98), now supporting mDNS short-code shorthand for Peer IDs!
- **📊 Modern TUI**: A rich, interactive terminal dashboard built with `ratatui` featuring rounded borders, colored semantic panels, and scrollable system logs.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Latest stable version.
- **Privileges**: RLN requires low-level network access.
  - **Linux**: `CAP_NET_RAW` capabilities or `sudo`.
  - **Windows**: Administrator privileges (Npcap recommended).

### Local Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rln.git
   cd rln
   ```

2. **Build and Run**:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release -- --dashboard
   ```

### Running with Docker (Recommended)

RLN is fully containerized with host networking support for seamless LAN scanning.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## 🔑 Identity & Peer IDs

RLN uses `iroh`'s native Ed25519 key primitives (`iroh::SecretKey` / `iroh::PublicKey`) to generate a unique node identity on first boot. The identity is saved to `data/identity.key` (chmod 600).

In the TUI, your node's `EndpointId` is displayed in the System Logs at startup. Other nodes use this ID (or its generated 8-character device shortcode via mDNS if operating on the local network) to dial you directly for file transfers:

```text
[ID] Peer ID: b09ceb10b3ca3e0aca54dace1998ba495911c5780dcd69b7307fb6bbd945504d
[P2P] Node online. ID: b09ceb10b3ca3e0aca54dace1998ba495911c5780dcd69b7307fb6bbd945504d
```

To send a file, press `s` to open the modal overlay, then type either your target's friendly name (`My-Laptop`), shortcode (`b09ceb10`), or full peer ID, and the file path:
```text
> b09ceb10 /home/user/doc.pdf
```

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

- **Zero-Cloud Guarantee**: All data stays on your machine. AI analysis and database storage happen 100% locally.
- **Privilege Separation**: Scanning components are isolated to minimize the surface area requiring elevated permissions.
- **Immutable Identity**: Your Peer ID is your source of truth. If you lose your identity file, you lose your trusted status with other nodes.
- **SHA-256 Integrity**: Every P2P file transfer includes a streaming SHA-256 digest verified by the receiver before the file is accepted.
